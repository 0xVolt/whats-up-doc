## Function Name: `generateRandomPassword`

### Arguments
* `length` (number): The length of the password to generate.

### Return Values
* `password` (string): The generated password.

### Explanation of Function Logic:
This function generates a random password by selecting characters from a given character set and concatenating them together. The length of the password is determined by the `length` argument passed to the function.

1. First, we define a character set that includes all lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
2. We then declare an empty string variable called `password` to store the generated password.
3. Inside a for loop, we select a random index from the `charset` array using the `Math.floor(Math.random() * charset.length)` expression. This ensures that each character has an equal chance of being selected.
4. We then concatenate the character at the selected index to the `password` variable.
5. After the for loop, we return the generated password.

## Function Name: `isPrime`

### Arguments
* `number` (number): The number to check if it is prime.

### Return Values
* `boolean`: True if the number is prime, false otherwise.

### Explanation of Function Logic:
This function checks if a given number is prime by iterating through a list of prime numbers and checking if the given number can be divided by any of them. If none of the prime numbers divide the given number evenly, it means that the number is prime.

1. First, we check if the input number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, we return false immediately since no positive integer is divisible by 0.
2. We then check if the input number is less than or equal to 3. If it is not, we can skip the remaining checks and directly return false since all even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.
3. Next, we iterate through a list of prime numbers from 5 up to the square root of the given number. We use the `Math.floor(Math.sqrt(number))` expression to compute the square root of the input number.
4. For each prime number in the list, we check if it divides the input number evenly using the modulo operator (%). If any of the prime numbers divide the input number evenly, we return false immediately since the input number is not prime.
5. After iterating through all prime numbers up to the square root of the input number, we return true if none of them divided the input number evenly, indicating that it is prime.

Note that this function assumes that all positive integers are prime except for 1 and 0, which are not prime. If you need to handle negative numbers or other edge cases, you may need to modify the function accordingly.
