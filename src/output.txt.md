Function Name: log_directory_structure

Description: This function logs the directory structure by recursively traversing through all subdirectories and files in the given directory path.

Arguments:
- `directory_path` (str): The path of the root directory to be logged. It should exist on the file system.
- `ai_context` (dict): A dictionary containing any additional context information that needs to be passed along with the log messages.
- `indent` (int, optional): An integer specifying how many spaces to indent each level of subdirectories in the output. Default is 0.

Return Values:
None - This function does not return a value.

Explanation:
1. The function first checks if the given directory path exists on the file system using `os.path.exists()` and prints an error message if it doesn't exist.
2. It then gets a list of all items in the directory using `os.listdir()`. 
3. For each item, it constructs the full path to that item by joining the directory path with the item name using `os.path.join()` and checks if it's a directory or file using `os.path.isdir()`.
4. If the item is a directory, it logs the directory using the given `ai_context` dictionary and recursively calls itself on that subdirectory with an increased indentation level using `log_directory_structure(item_path, ai_context, indent + 1)`. 
5. If the item is a file, it can log it similarly.
6. The function then prompts the user to enter the directory path and logs the root directory with that path.
7. Finally, it calls itself on the given `directory_path` using `log_directory_structure(directory_path, ai_context)`.
