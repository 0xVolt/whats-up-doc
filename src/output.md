## Function Name: `generate_random_password`

### Arguments
* `length` (int, optional): The length of the generated password. Default is 8.

### Return Values
A randomly generated password composed of characters from the ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.

### Explanation of Function Logic:
1. The function defines a list of characters that can be used to generate the password. These characters are a combination of ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.
2. It then uses the `random` module to generate a random password of the desired length. It does this by iterating over the length using a for loop and selecting a character from the defined list using the `random.choice()` function. The selected character is then concatenated into a single string using the `.join()` method.
3. Finally, the generated password is returned.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```python
>>> generate_random_password()
'hgmB$7LJ4'
```
In this example, a random password of 8 characters was generated and printed to the console. You can modify the `length` argument to generate passwords of different lengths by changing the value passed to the function.

## Function Name: `is_anagram`

### Arguments
* `str1` (str): The first string to check for anagrams. It is required.
* `str2` (str): The second string to check for anagrams. It is required.

### Return Values
True if the two strings are anagrams, otherwise False.

### Explanation of Function Logic:
1. First, it sorts both input strings using `sorted()`. This is necessary because the function needs to compare the strings element-wise to determine if they are anagrams.
2. Then, it checks if the sorted versions of the two strings are equal by comparing them element-wise using `==`. If they are equal, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Here's how you can document the function for your project:

## Function Name: `is_anagram`

### Arguments

* `str1` (str): The first string to check for anagrams. It is required.
* `str2` (str): The second string to check for anagrams. It is required.

### Return Values
True if the two strings are anagrams, otherwise False.

### Explanation of Function Logic

The function first sorts both input strings using `sorted()`. This is necessary because the function needs to compare the strings element-wise to determine if they are anagrams. Then, it checks if the sorted versions of the two strings are equal by comparing them element-wise using `==`. If they are equal, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

For example, if you pass `"apple"` and `"plea"`, the function will return `True` because the sorted versions of both strings are equal: `"apple"` and `"plea"`. On the other hand, if you pass `"apple"` and `"table"` (which are not anagrams), the function will return `False`.
