## Function Name: `generate_random_password`

### Arguments
* `length` (int, optional): The length of the generated password. Defaults to 8.

### Return Values
A randomly generated password as a string.

### Explanation of Function Logic:
1. The function first imports `string` and `random` modules from Python's standard library.
2. It then defines a variable `characters` which contains all the possible characters that can be used to generate a password, including letters, digits, and punctuations.
3. Next, it generates a password of length `length` using the `join()` method of the `str` class with an empty string as the separator. The `random.choice()` function is used to randomly select characters from the `characters` variable.
4. Finally, it returns the generated password as a string.

In summary, this function generates a random password of the specified length by randomly selecting characters from a predefined pool of allowed characters.
