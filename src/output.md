## Function Name: `generateRandomPassword`

### Arguments
* `length` (number): The length of the password to generate.

### Return Values
* `password` (string): The generated password.

### Explanation of Function Logic:
1. The function takes in a single argument, `length`, which represents the desired length of the generated password.
2. The function creates a string variable called `charset` that contains all the possible characters to be used in the password. This includes lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, special characters, and some additional characters like exclamation marks and parentheses.
3. The function initializes an empty string variable called `password`.
4. A for loop is used to iterate over each character in the `charset` string. For each iteration, a random index is generated using the `Math.floor(Math.random() * charset.length)` formula, which returns a number between 0 and the length of the `charset` string minus 1.
5. The character at the randomly generated index is added to the `password` variable using the `+=` operator.
6. After all characters in the `charset` string have been iterated over, the final `password` string is returned.

## Function Name: `isPrime`

### Arguments
* `number` (number): The number to be checked for primality.

### Return Values
* `true` or `false` (boolean): Whether the given number is prime or not, respectively.

### Explanation of Function Logic:
1. The function takes in a single argument, `number`, which represents the number to be checked for primality.
2. If `number <= 1`, the function returns `false` immediately since all numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
3. If `number <= 3`, the function returns `true` immediately since only 2 and 3 are prime numbers less than or equal to 3.
4. Otherwise, the function proceeds with the rest of its logic.
5. The function checks if `number` is divisible by 2 or 3 using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is not divisible, the function returns `false`.
6. The function initializes a variable called `i` to 5 and starts iterating over all numbers that are multiples of 5 greater than 5. For each iteration, the function checks if `number` is divisible by the current value of `i` using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is not divisible, the function returns `false`.
7. The function increments the value of `i` by 6 for each iteration and continues until the square root of `number` is reached.
8. After all numbers that are multiples of `i` greater than 5 have been checked, the function returns `true` if `number` has not yet been proven to be composite, and `false` otherwise.
