## Function Name: `generate_random_password`

### Arguments
* `length` (int, optional): The length of the generated password. Default is 8.

### Return Values
A randomly generated password consisting of characters from the specified character set.

### Explanation of Function Logic:
1. The function defines a list of characters that can be used to generate the password, which includes ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation marks.
2. It then creates an empty password by using `join()` method to concatenate random characters from the character set using `random.choice()`. The length of the password is determined by the value of `length` parameter or default value of 8.
3. Finally, it returns the generated password.

Note: The function does not take any additional parameters other than the `length` parameter, which is optional.

## Function Name: `is_anagram`

### Arguments
* `str1` (str): The first string to check for anagrams. It is required.
* `str2` (str): The second string to check for anagrams. It is required.

### Return Values
True - if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.

### Explanation of Function Logic:
1. First, it sorts both input strings using `sorted()` to ensure they are in alphabetical order.
2. Then, it compares the sorted versions of the two strings by checking if they are equal using `==`. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
3. It's a simple and straightforward implementation of the anagram checker.
