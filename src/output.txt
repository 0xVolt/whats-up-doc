    The `readFile` function takes in one argument, `path`, which is a string representing the path of the script file to be read. It returns a string containing the contents of the script file.

    Here's how it works:

    1. A with block is used to open the specified file in read mode using the `open` function.
    2. The `read()` method is called on the file object returned by `open`, which reads all the contents of the file into a string variable named `code`.
    3. The `with` block automatically closes the file after it's done being used, ensuring that any resources are properly released.

    Example Usage:

    ```python
    code = readFile('example.py')
    print(code)
    ```
