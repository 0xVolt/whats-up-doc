      "1. First, install the necessary dependencies for your chosen language. For example, if you're using Rust, you can install the `websockets` crate by running the following command in your terminal:\n",
      "```\n",
      "cargo install websockets\n",
      "```\n",
      "2. Next, create a new project directory and initialize it as a Cargo project (for Rust) or an Xcode project (for C++).\n",
      "3. In your project directory, create a new file called `main.rs` (for Rust) or `main.cpp` (for C++) and add the following code to it:\n",
      "```rust\n",
      "use websockets::{WebSocket, WebSocketBuilder};\n",
      "use std::net::TcpListener;\n",
